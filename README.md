# E-shop Frontend Project
*Ing. Emil Exenberger, PhD., MBA*

## Overview
This is the frontend component of an e-shop application, developed using React. It communicates with the backend component to provide a complete e-commerce experience, including product browsing, user authentication, cart management, and order processing. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/emilexenberger/eshop-backend).

## Technologies Used

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **React**
- **Bootstrap** (Styling and layout)
- **Lodash** (Utility functions, such as `orderBy`)

### Additional Skills
- **State Management** (React hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`)
- **Routing and Navigation** (React Router with `Route`, `Routes`)
- **HTTP Requests** (`fetch`, `async/await`)
- **Data Formatting** (`Intl.NumberFormat`)

### Component-based Development
- Modular components for the user interface.
- Integration with backend via RESTful APIs.

### Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with React Context and `useAuthContext`.
- Conditional rendering based on authentication status and user roles.

### UI and UX
- **Navbars and Footers** (Reusable components for navigation and layout)
- **Forms and Validation** (Custom form handling and validation logic)
